<p>For the most recent information, I recommend reading the
<a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/#news">LA county public health press releases</a>.</p>

<p>Adding numbers for last 30 days since there are lots of reporting dips and
spikes, so it can be usefull to crossreference with recent numbers.</p>

<h2>Playground</h2>
<p>I was curious to compare prior lags in hospitalizations from cases to see where
we would be if Omicron is behaving similarly to the previous Delta wave (post
vaccination effort, and return to normal), and the bigger winter 2021 wave (pre
vaccination effort, lockdown). The data below are normalized between 1 and 0 for
comparison purposes. Hospitalization and ICU data have been shifted back 7 days
which corresponds roughly to the lag seen in the rise of hospitalizations for
the big winter 2021 wave. I am seeing a rise in hospitalizations for Omicron,
but it appears to be considerably delayed relative to previous waves. There is
no evidence yet of a similarly large increase in ICU admission as was typically
seen in the prior waves. As of this note on Thursday, December 30th, I think
we are still a couple of weeks out from knowing the trajectory of the LA Omicron
ICU and hospitalization wave.</p>

<p>Saw some chatter on Twitter about the circular plot of cases published by the
NYT
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/omicron-covid-us.html">here behind a paywall</a>.
My personal take is that I think the NYT makes some great visualizations and if
you just want to follow along with case numbers, sure the circle plot is,
unnecessary. But, if that is you, youâ€™re probably best served by the standard
NYT covid case tracking page
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html">here</a>!
Anyhow, I thought it might be fun to try to reproduce the figure with LA data</p>
