<p>For the most recent information, read the
<a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/#news">LA county public health press releases</a>.</p>

<p>Below are the reported numbers for the last 30 days. Use this to check for
reporting weirdness and to get a more precise feel of LA numbers over time.</p>

<h2>Playground</h2>
<p>Below is a comparison of cases, hospitalizations, ICU and deaths relative to the
peak in winter 2021. Hospitalizations and ICU admissions have been shifted back
9 days, and Deaths have been shifted back 22 days as this was the approximate
lag for the winter 2021 wave.</p>

<p>With so many new cases in recent days, I was curious what fraction of LA
countyâ€™s population has gotten covid during the omicron wave. Without
considering duplicates, and assuming that December 2021 was the start of this
wave, there have been 791,541 confirmed cases, which is roughly
7.7% of the population.</p>
<p>Saw some chatter on Twitter about the circular plot of cases published by the
NYT
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/omicron-covid-us.html">here behind a paywall</a>.
My personal take is that the figure evokes more emotion than it provides useful
information, which I think is the point since this is a NYT Opinion piece.
Anyhow, I thought it might be fun to try to reproduce the figure with LA data.
