<h2>Who made this site?</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EricEdwrdBryant">I did</a>! And I am not an epidemiologist,
nor should I be considered an expert on COVID-19, or infectious disease.</p>

<div id="who-is-this-covid-tracker-for" class="section level2">
<h2>Who is this COVID tracker for?</h2>
<p>It’s mostly for me, and a way for me to share what I think is the most relevant
information that gets presented on the many COVID dashboards that already exist.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-dashboards" class="section level2">
<h2>Other dashboards?</h2>
<p>There are many other dashboards that exist from official sources. Check them
out!</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard">LA county COVID-19 dashboard</a>
<ul>
<li>This one has a regional breakdown in LA. Nice!</li>

<div id="what-do-i-think-is-the-most-relevant-information" class="section level2">
<h2>What do I think is the most relevant information?</h2>
<p>For me (and my friends, and my family) I think the most important thing is to be
aware of COVID-19 prevalence in our communities. Fortunately, CA publishes new
positive SARS-CoV-2 tests every day with a county level breakdown. This is an
imperfect metric and should be considered an underestimate of community
prevalence because it only catches cases that were actually tested. Reporting
is also a bit off as we can see strong weekly periodicity when we visualize the
raw data, which is why I include a two week rolling average and a smooth curve
when plotting daily new cases.</p>
<p>That said, the smoothed curves are also likely underestimating community
prevalence as the under-reporting on certain days drags the whole average down.
The more important thing to pay attention to is whether daily new cases are
increasing, stable, or decreasing. Increases in daily new cases means that every
new cases is resulting in more than one additional new case, such that spread is
no longer being controlled. Decreasing daily new cases indicates that our
control measures are working.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-dont-you-include-daily-new-deaths" class="section level2">
<h2>Why don’t you include daily new deaths?</h2>
<p>Want more data? See the dashboards linked above! That said, be careful when
interpreting daily new deaths. This measure lags by several weeks behind daily
new cases. While I think it is important to keep in mind that many people have
died and continue to die from this disease, I do not think monitoring daily new
deaths helps individuals assess the current prevalence of COVID-19 in their
communities, and thus does not inform us how to act today to avoid getting
and/or spreading COVID-19.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that daily new deaths (i.e. new reported deaths yesterday) is
<em>not</em> the same thing as infection fatality rate (IFR i.e. rate of death among
infected persons). IFR is something that you should probably only worry about
<em>if</em> you get COVID-19 and even then, you would want the IFR for someone of your
same demographic with the same co-morbidities etc. And, even then, it still is a
poor indicator for how <em>you</em> will respond to COVID-19. IFR is something more
relevant to policy makers and people running clinical trials that they use,
along with many other important factors, to help assess the current standard of
care and the status of our healthcare system. So, instead of worrying about
crude death rates, or IFR, listen to public health experts when they say this is
a serious disease that needs to be managed and not ignored.</p>

<div id="is-this-covid-tracker-updated-automatically" class="section level2">
<h2>Is this COVID tracker updated automatically?</h2>
<p>At the moment, no. I have to click a couple buttons to update with the latest
daily numbers reported in California, which I plan on doing when I have my
morning coffee. I would like to automate this (possibly using
<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/">Travis</a>), but I can live with a
couple clicks for now.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-loess-estimate" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the “loess estimate”?</h2>
<p>LOESS stands for “LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing,” and is just the
algorithm I used to fit smooth curves (i.e. make the line pretty). This
estimated curve is also used to annotate the numbers directly on the plot that
provide to tell us the approximate peak and current value for daily new cases.
The exact numbers should not be taken too seriously, as they are almost
certainly underestimates of actual COVID-19 prevalence. That said these
estimates will not fluctuate as wildly as the raw reported daily new cases –
this is intentional as these fluctuations are almost certainly reporting
artifacts that should be ignored.</p>
